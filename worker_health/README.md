# worker health tools

## missing_workers

Helps us identify Bitbar workers that are configured in a TC queue that has pending jobs, but aren't reporting for work.

If a queue doesn't have work, we can't verify they're functioning (via the currently used method).

### usage

```
./missing_workers.sh -h
./fitness.py -h
...
```

### examples

#### fitness.py

![fitness.py](images/fitness_py_example.png)

```

./fitness.py -p terraform-packet
```
